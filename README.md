# ðŸ“š Gravity Books Database Analysis (CIS525 Project)

This project was developed as part of my MBA in Business Analytics (CIS525 â€“ Applied Data Structure and Databases). It focuses on analyzing the **Gravity Books** database using **MySQL**, a widely-used open-source relational database management system. But addicional work will be done on it, for a complementary development skill.

The analysis began with the construction of an **Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)** to map out the structure of the databaseâ€”highlighting primary keys, foreign keys, relationships between tables, and essential data types.

## ðŸŽ¯ Business Goals

This project answers **four key business questions** posed by Gravity Booksâ€™ upper management:

1. **Which publisher** should be selected for a special promotion?
2. **Which country** has the highest number of active customers?
3. What are the **five least popular books** among customers?
4. Which **shipping method** is the least efficient and may be discontinued?

Additional insights were also explored, based on trends and hidden patterns in customer behavior, product sales, and fulfillment operations.

## ðŸ”§ Tools & Skills Used
- **MySQL** â€“ SQL queries, joins, aggregations, filtering
- **Database Modeling** â€“ ERD creation and interpretation
- **Business Intelligence** â€“ Data storytelling and decision-making
- **Data Cleaning & Analysis** â€“ Structured problem-solving
